# Jungle-apk
This is an android browser which I had created during the initial days in the learning process of coding.
One of the basic browser coded completely in block based coding language.

MIT app inventor in a platform where anyone can create instant apps with the help of block based coding.
As soon as I aquired this knowledge I started making many android apps and this was one among them.

The default search engine it uses is StartPage one of the most secure search engines.
This has a very basic and easy to use layout.

I named it jungle as i wanted to get wild with coding and dive deep in this field.
